# React Tic-Tac-Toe Project

## Usage

This project uses the Tic Tac Toe project resource files from MIT xPRO React course. In addition the starter files, there is a new button "New Game" to allow resetting the board.
Some fixes include disabling button click on the Square tile when it is already filled and if there is already a winner.
Made use of useEffect hook to check if there is a winner everytime the game board state changes.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a scoreboard to keep track of the number of wins of each player, possible through another state.
- CSS styling using Bootstrap or other UI frameworks.
